# PapuuGame
It's an HTML5 Game. You are pappu in the game, a little character. You need to click the mouse or tap (touch screen) to levitate else pappu will descend. If he hits the top or bottom boundaries that'll end the game. There will be some obstacles along the way like forks, branches and some enemies who are also known as "pakias". Hitting them will end the game. 3 types of pakias - sad (pull you), happy (push you), angry (kill you). Keep safe distance from them! There are some collectibles too! Coins for points (yellow for 50, pink for 100, red for 500). Stars for invincibility for a short period. Berries spawning clones that'll destroy anything that comes in their way!
